# WebGL Exploding Teapots
WebGL project which renders up to 10 teapot models that explode.
The program also tessellates the low poly model to a smoother one.

The user interface has two sliders which allow users to toggle
number of teapots and how many times the tessellation algorithm is called.

To run, clone the repository then in this directory run
`python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
from your command line. Open up localhost:8000 and the project should run.
